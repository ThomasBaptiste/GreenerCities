As of now:

-ingest/make_grid.py makes a square grid over a given european city, next steps:
 > load the data from the different cities to verify if everything works at first
 > If it works, remove the output from make_grid and make a load_grid.py file
 > Write unit tests for make_grid.py


Afterwards, we will need to check public datasets to find:
 > Which features we want
 > How we can access them
 > How to get them for the city only

Next step will be to clean/format the data
